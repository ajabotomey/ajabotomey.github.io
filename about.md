My name is Andrew Abotomey, also known as AJ. I am an aspiring game programmer with skills primarily as a programmer. These skills are not limited to Graphics, Gameplay, AI and Tools Programming.  I was an academic tutor at Griffith University primarily teaching multimedia courses with a primary focus on Games Development with the Unity Game Engine.

I am currently studying a Graduate Diploma in Management (Learning) with the Academy of Interactive Entertainment’s Sydney Campus with the option of learning online because I live in another state.

I finished my Advanced Diploma in Professional Game Development with the Academy of Interactive Entertainment’s Online Campus specialising in Game Programming back in 2017.

I finished my Bachelor of Information Technology with Honours from Griffith University in 2015 after completing my thesis testing the feasibility of WiFi localization using RSSI data measured both indoors and outdoors by looking at the maximum distance error from the regression method and the Margin of Error (MoE) given by the Confidence Interval.
