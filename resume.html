                <p>My role in Introduction to Multimedia was to teach students the basic of multimedia by using Flash as an authoring tool. ActionScript 3.0 was also taught to enhance their applications by using code.</p>
                <p>My role in 3D Games Development was to assist the students in any way possible while teaching them the basics of Unity3D as well as basic C# programming. I also guided the students through their final projects to ensure that they realized their potential as game designers or game programmers.</p>
                <p>My role in Dynamic Multimedia Systems involved teaching students how to create their own Single Web Applications using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery. I also taught students how to access the Facebook and Flickr Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for their own applications. </p>
                <p>With all of these courses, lab exercises needed to be marked and I also assisted students wherever I could with these exercises.</p>
