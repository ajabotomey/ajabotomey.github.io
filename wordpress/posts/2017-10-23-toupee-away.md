Toupee Away is a fast paced, third person networked-multiplayer stealth game which takes place in the White House. Players must either take on the role of President Ronald Rumpfâ€™s toupee, as they attempt to navigate hostile territory in order to leak incriminating information to the press or President Ronald Rumpf as he attempts to capture the toupees before they can irreparably ruin his reputation.

I worked on this game as the sole programmer for Team Wing It. My responsibilities included:
<ul>
 	<li>Programming all game mechanics</li>
 	<li>Working on matchmaking and networking functionality</li>
</ul>
