Well, it's been a while since I updated this blog. Although I intended to post to it more often, university studies got in the way. I did have to build a game for one of my projects and a fair bit went wrong. Murphy's Law simply kicked in at the wrong time. 

Luckily I have now since graduated from my double Bachelors degree and am now studying my Bachelor of I.T. with Honours. Hopefully I can figure out my thesis topic relatively soon once my boss/supervisor comes into the office.
