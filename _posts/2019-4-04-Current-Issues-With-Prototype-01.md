name: Current Issues with Prototype 0.1

Current issues include the following: (Will add more as they arise)
- I need to work on the camera a bit more
- Better visual feedback on the guard field of view so people can avoid it.
- Better art. I used tile sprites from OpenGameArt.com to so the level and the player/guard are using basic Unity Sprites
